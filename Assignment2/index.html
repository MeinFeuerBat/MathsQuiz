	  <h5>Brief history of HTML</h5>
	  <p>
	  HTML was first written in 1993 by Tim Berners Lee. 
	  From that point forward, there have been various variants of HTML. 
	  The most broadly utilized adaptation all through the 2000's was HTML 4.01, 
	  which was authorized and recognized as a official version before the 2000s. 
	  Then there was XML language, which was the modified version of HTML. 
	  XML is a standard markup language that is utilized to make other markup languages, with many of them being used today. 
	  There was also XHTML which was recognized as an official language starting 2000s. 
	  XHTML is basically the same as HTML except that it has much more stricter guidelines that it requires you to follow.  
	  Each version of HTML starting from HTML 3.0 since has improved very significantly and then In 2012, 
	  an extended version of HTML 4.0 was published, called HTML 5.0 which has been in use since then and 
	  nowadays everything is much easier to code on web for example unlike before, now you can put an internal link for any video or audio with HTML5 (also 4).
